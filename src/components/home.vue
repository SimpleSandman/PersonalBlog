                <strong>A Bio</strong><br>
                Hey, my name's Preston. I'm currently 27 years old. I write for a living and have been doing so since ~2011.
                I don't write books, blog posts (I've written three), or news articles. I write code. Mainly web based development.<br>
                While not at work I continue to work in my spare time. If I find time outside of my spare time, I'll play games,
                attempt to go outside, and maybe even eat or sleep.<br>
                I have three cats. If that matters.
            </li>

                <strong>Projects</strong><br>
                There's not much in the way of this. My <span class="strikethrough">house</span> apartment is full of projects.
                <ul>
                    <li>Refurbished coffee table -- Co-refurbished with my brother</li>
                    <li>A hand made computer desk &amp; dining room table -- Co-developed with the better half</li>
                    <li>A leather quiver</li>
                    <li>Various Arduino based projects like a "Soil is too dry, water me before I die" thing</li>
                    <li>
                        Numerous tinkerings on <a href="//codepen.io/wildbeard" target="_blank">my CodePen</a> -- None of these are complex but fun none the less
                        <ul>
                            <li>I've had a handful of Pens picked and listed right there on the homepage </li>
                            <li>I participated in the <a href="//codepen.io/collection/DKyvWY" target="_blank">Daily CSS Challenges</a> (when I had time) and most of those became Picked Pens<sup>*</sup></li>
                            <li>
                                I also jumped onto the <a href="//codepen.io/wildbeard/pen/JNQzEZ" target="_blank">Fidget Spinner Bandwagon</a> -- What do you know it became a Picked Pen<sup>*</sup><br>
                                I don't want to say I started a trend but after this showed up on the front page the day I made it a lot of people made their own versions. Trend. Setter. :^)
                             </li>
                            <li>Oh, and there's this <a href="//codepen.io/wildbeard/pen/BRXEGd" target="_blank">Self Portrait</a> -- A Picked Pen<sup>*</sup></li>
                            <li>Also this popular <a href="//codepen.io/wildbeard/pen/eZZPZr" target="_blank">Pen</a> -- I have no idea why it is so popular I thought it was dumb when I made it</li>
                            <li><sup>*</sup> = Picked Pens mean nothing in reality only that one of the editors saw it liked it</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>I've got a few of the typical developer side projects -- You know the ones we start but never finish.</li>
                </ul>
