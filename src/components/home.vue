                    TL;DR: Develop, maintain, and Moonshot the majority of internal tools that powers the agency globally.<br>Time reporting? Got it. Onboarding? Yup. User management (including 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> party management)? Got it. Slack integration? Sure why not. Custom Form, HR Documents, Password Management? Done. Real time notifications across the agency's internal sites? Nailed it.
